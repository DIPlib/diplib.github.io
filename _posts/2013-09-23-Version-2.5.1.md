Version 2.5.1 of *DIPlib* and *DIPimage* has been released.

We fixed a few minor bugs concerning the computation with binary and complex images.

## Change list

- Changes to *DIPimage*

    - Changed functions:
        - `hist_equalize` now accepts a histogram as a second input argument; the image's histogram will be modified to match it.
        - All numeric parameters to *DIPimage* functions (e.g. filter size) can now have any type, and will be automatically converted to doubles.
        - `gaussianblob` now can place multiple blobs at the same time, which is much faster than repeatedly calling the function.

    - Bug fixes:
        - Complex arithmetic is, once again, possible (bug introduced in version 2.5).
        - Logic operations (`&`, `|`, `xor`) can again be applied to non-binary images (bug introduced in version 2.5).
        - Arithmetic between a binary image and a scalar now again yields a `sfloat` image (bug introduced in version 2.5).
        - It is now possible to read image files that have quotes or other difficult characters in them.
