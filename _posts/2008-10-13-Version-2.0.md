Version 2.0 of *DIPlib* and *DIPimage* has been released for Linux and Windows both 32- and 64-bits.
Also the number of supported MATLAB versions has been extended, ranging from
MATLAB 6.0/R12 (for Windows 32-bits) to MATLAB 7.7/R2008b (for all platforms).

NOTE: in Linux the Java interface of *DIPimage* crashes with MATLAB 7.0/R14 till 7.3/R2006b.
This can be solved by starting MATLAB with the `-nojvm` option!
