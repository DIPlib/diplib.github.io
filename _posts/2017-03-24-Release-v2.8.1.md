Version 2.8.1 of DIPlib and DIPimage has been released.

Starting this version Windows 32-bits is no longer supported.

<h3>Change list:</h3>

- Changes to DIPimage:

    - Changed functions:

        - `countneighbours` adds a new option to only count neighbors of foreground pixels.
        NOTE! this change affects compatibility!

        - `radialsum` is faster now for 2D images.

    - Bug fixes:

        - `ft` and `ift` threw an error when `'FFTtype'` preference was set to `'fftw'` and the image had
        singleton dimensions.

        - `xx`, `yy`, `createramp` and related functions now correctly compute the frequency-domain coordinates
        for uneven-sized images.
