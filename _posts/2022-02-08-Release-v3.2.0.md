Today *DIPlib* 3.2.0 was released. It includes some new functionality and some assorted bug fixes.
Please see the [change log](/changelogs/diplib_3.2.0.html) for details.

We recommend that all users upgrade to the new release.

---

**For use from Python**, install through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/diplib/) using

    pip install diplib

We support Windows, macOS and Linux, and Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. On Linux, Python 3.6 is
also supported. For macOS on the new Apple Silicon machines, we support Python versions 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.

If you use a different platform or a different version of Python, you will need to build
from source. This is not complicated. We have
[simple and clear instructions available](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

Note that there are some changes that could break your existing code, but this can be easily
fixed. See the change log linked above before upgrading.

**For use from MATLAB**, get a *DIPimage* installer [on GitHub](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib/releases).

If there is no installer for your platform or your version of MATLAB, you will need to build from source.
This is not complicated. We have
[simple and clear instructions available](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

**For use from C++**, please build from source. This should be a lot easier for you than messing
with pre-compiled libraries and their linker compatibility issues. We recommend that you use *CMake*
to build a project using *DIPlib*, either using the *DIPlib* repository as a sub-project, or following
[this example *CMake* file](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib/blob/master/examples/independent_project/CMakeLists.txt).
If you don't want to use *CMake*, then see
[here](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib/blob/master/INSTALL.md#linking-against-the-library) for
instructions on which preprocessor macros to define.

Though there should not need to change any of your code to use the new version of library,
you will have to re-compile it, since some function signatures were changed in backwards-compatible ways.
