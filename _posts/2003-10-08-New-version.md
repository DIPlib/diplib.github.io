New versions have been made available for Linux, SunOS and Windows. We have changed our policy
concerning the time limits built into DIPlib: all versions are limitless now.

Unfortunately we can no longer provide Linux versions that work with MATLAB 5.3, so we are dropping support
for that version. The previous version without a time limit is available through the download-page.

Similarly, the IRIX and Alpha/OSF1 versions are not updated regularly because we do not have these machines
ourselves.
