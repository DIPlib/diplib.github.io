We've recently published a chapter in a book on medical image analysis edited by Geoff Dougherty.
The chapter shows how you can use a tool like *DIPimage* to do rapid prototyping of an image analysis application.
Rapid prototyping means quickly trying out new ideas, and requires being able to implement these ideas in a simple,
intuitive manner, in little time, and for little cost. The chapter uses automated analysis of Pap smears as an
example, taking the reader through the 60 years of advances in this field, and showing how the key concepts can be
reproduced with only a few lines of code.
