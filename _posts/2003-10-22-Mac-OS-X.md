Finally we made the effort to release the Mac OS X version of DIPlib and DIPimage.
Since we do not use this version ourselves, there might be some small problems.
We do not, however, expect any major issues. Please let us know how it works out for you.
The DIPimage User Manual explains the installation procedure, and also gives some hints on
using MATLAB under Mac OS X.
