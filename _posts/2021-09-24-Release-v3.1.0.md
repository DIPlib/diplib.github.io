We recommend that all users upgrade to the new release.

**For use from Python**, install through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/diplib/) using

    pip install diplib

We support Windows, macOS and Linux, and Python versions 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. On Linux also 3.6 is
supported. If you use a different platform or a different version of Python, you will need to build
from source. This is not complicated. We have
[simple and clear instructions available](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

**For use from MATLAB**, you need to build from source. This is not complicated. We have
[simple and clear instructions available](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
We don't yet have a simple way of generating the *DIPimage* distribution (MATLAB toolbox), hopefully
one day we will.

**For use from C++**, please build from source. This should be a lot easier for you than messing
with pre-compiled libraries and their linker compatibility issues.

Though there should not need to change any of your code to use the new version of library,
you will have to re-compile it, since some function signatures were changed in backwards-compatible ways.
