Version 2.0.2 of *DIPlib* and *DIPimage* has been released with bugfixes. Release can now be downloaded directly!

## Change list

- Changes to *DIPimage*

    - Changed functions:
        - `bilateralf`: uv-separable bilateral filter extended to 3D.
        - `threshold`: added Otsu's method and minimum error method.

- Changes to *DIPlib*  
    (These propagate to *DIPimage*)

    - Changed functions:
        - `dip_ArcFilter` (used for bilateral filtering) extended to 3D (only for the straight filter).

    - Bug fixes:
        - `dip_AdaptiveGauss` and similar adaptive filters produced `NaN`s if one of the filtering sigma's was zero.
        - `dip_AdaptiveGauss` sometimes gave segmentation violation on 64-bits Linux
