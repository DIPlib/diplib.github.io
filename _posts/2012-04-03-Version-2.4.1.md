Version 2.4.1 of DIPlib and DIPimage has been released.

<h3>Change list:</h3>

- Changes to DIPimage

    - Bug fixes:
        - A change in the previous release caused image division to behave differently than before. Dividing by 0 produces `Inf` or `NaN` again.
        - `bmajority()`, `correctshift()`, `countneighbours()` and `extend()` did not properly restore the global boundary condition in case an error occurred.

- Changes to DIPlib  
(These might or might not propagate to DIPimage)

    - Changed functions:
        - The image division functions now produce `NaN` or `Inf` when dividing by 0 (instead of giving 0).

    - Bug fixes:
        - Fix in `dip_ScanFrameWork()` that caused `dip_IsodataThreshold()` to crash under some circumstances.
        - `dipm_CDiv()` returned incorrect results.
