Version 2.9 of *DIPlib* and *DIPimage* has been released.

Due to recent changes in MacOS and MATLAB, the MacOS (Darwin) distribution has no *OpenMP*.

## Change list

- Changes to *DIPimage*:

    - Changed function:
        - Subscripted assignments (e.g. `m(:,:,0)=some_2d_image`) are much faster and use much less memory, usually. See `help dip_image/subsasgn`.  
          Note: this new behaviour is deactivated by default and needs to be enabled using `dipsetpref`.
