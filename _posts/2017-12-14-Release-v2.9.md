Version 2.9 of DIPlib and DIPimage has been released.

Due to recent changes in MacOS and MATLAB, the MacOS (Darwin) distribution has no OpenMP.

<h3>Change list:</h3>

- Changes to DIPimage:

    - Changed function:

        - Subscripted assignments (e.g. `m(:,:,0)=some_2d_image`) are much faster and use much less memory, usually.
          See `help dip_image/subsasgn`.
          Note: this new behaviour is deactivated by default and needs to be enabled using `dipsetpref`.
