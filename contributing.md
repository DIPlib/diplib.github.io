# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the *DIPlib* project, there are many different
ways of doing so:

- Write new algorithms. If you have an algorithm that you'd like to contribute
  to the project, we'll be happy to see it!

- Create an interface to another library or scripting language.

- Create tutorials for how to use *DIPlib*, *DIPimage* and/or *PyDIP*.

- Fix bugs or improve documentation.

- Add code to the unit tests.

- Create a logo for the project.

In any of these cases, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/DIPlib/diplib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to learn how to make optimal use of your time.
Don't be offended if you receive requests for modifications before your work is merged
with the project.

Your documentation and code contributions will carry the same licencing terms as the rest
of the library, you keep the copyright to any substantial contribution.
