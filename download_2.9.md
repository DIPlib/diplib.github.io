<h1>Download *DIPlib* and *DIPimage* version 2.9</h1>

The links below can be used to obtain a non-commercial license. This license is free, and can be used by students
and staff in a University research project *without* an industrial sponsor. If you need to obtain the commercial
license for version 2.9 or older of *DIPlib* and *DIPimage*, please contact <a href="B.Rieger@tudelft.nl">Bernd Rieger</a>.

Version 2.9 of *DIPimage* is compatible with MATLAB R2008a and up. This version will not run on older versions of MATLAB!

- On MacOS, this version of *DIPimage* is compatible only with MATLAB R2009bSP1 and up.
- MATLAB R2015b has a "feature" which results in an error with some *DIPimage* functions (e.g. read color images). This
"feature" has been resolved in version R2016a. In other words: do **not** use MATLAB R2015b with *DIPimage*
- Starting this version, 32-bit Windows is no longer supported. For 32-bit Windows support please
<a href="#older>download an older version</a>.

You may download and use *DIPimage* and *DIPlib* after complying with the following three terms of use:
1. I agree to all terms in the <a href="#license">license agreement</a>.
2. I declare I will use *DIPimage* or *DIPlib* only for non-commercial purposes.
3. I declare I will not redistribute any of this software.

- For Windows 64-bits <a href="ftp://qiftp.tudelft.nl/DIPimage/2.9/DIPimage%202.9%20installer%20win64.exe" target="_blank">DIPimage 2.9 installer win64.exe</a>
  (recommended) or <a href="ftp://qiftp.tudelft.nl/DIPimage/2.9/dipimage_2.9_win64.zip" target="_blank">dipimage_2.9_win64.zip</a> (for manual installation).

The set of demo images can be downloaded in two forms: 
<a href="ftp://qiftp.tudelft.nl/DIPimage/images.tbz" target="_blank">images.tbz</a> or
<a href="ftp://qiftp.tudelft.nl/DIPimage/images.zip" target="_blank">images.zip</a>.
Both files contain the same files, so you only need to download one format.

All versions have been tested on the following platforms:
